This is an app for people who save a lot of knowledge as notes in Markdown format, usually for the purposes of perserving knowledge or documentation; like having your own wiki, or a second brain.

As someone who did this for over a decade, I developed a habit where after I wrote a note, I would forget most of it. Maybe my brain was optimising, knowing that I can easily retrieve the knowledge later.

However, there are some knowledge you might wish to retain and commit to memory. This app aims to help with that, so as a first step: add your selected MD notes, update the frontmatter and feed it into this app to easily create a quiz.

For now, the key information are: `title` (question) and the text body (answer). `category` will be used in future to track performance in different categories (ie: correct %). The other fields for now are just for personal reference (app doesn't use, but maybe in future).
