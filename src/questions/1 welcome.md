Glad you clicked the answer.

You can see this as a short 6 part tutorial aimed to address the whats & whys of this app.

If you're one of those devs that want the 1 line tl;dr so you can be on your way, I guess the fist line of README.md should have suffice.

For everyone else willing to read the docs, you can see this as a kind of docs for the app.
